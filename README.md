# OriginTrail V8 Incentivised Testnet - Guides
OriginTrail - Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG), Run an Node V8 Incentivised Testnet - Buidl to Measure, Manage, and Master
## Here We Go...Guys!!!
**`OriginTrail community, driven by an incentivised testnet system. The goal of the V8 incentivised testnet is to ensure security, scalability and usability for all ecosystem participants in a joint test environment, before releasing the new version to the DKG mainnet. An incentivising all eligible contributors with a total incentive pool of 1,000,000 TRAC tokens.`**

*There following four categories of contributions and their incentive pools are indicated below.*
| Incentivised Activity               | Required Technical Level | Reward Budget  |
|-------------------------------------|--------------------------|---------------|
| Staking & UI testing                | Low                      | 50 000 TRAC   |
| Running core nodes                  | Medium                   | 100 000 TRAC  |
| Bug submissions & Code contributions| Medium                   | 100 000 TRAC  |
| Building Paranets (inception program for Builders) | High | 750 000 TRAC  |

*The V8 incentivised testnet will go through a "3 layer launch", each layer introducing new functionality*
- **Core Infrastructure Layer: Run V8 core nodes**
- **Security Layer: V8 staking**
- **AI Layer: V8 edge nodes**

## Preparation for V8 DKG Core Node Running
**1. Hardware requirements:**
In order to deploy your V8 DKG node, you will need a Linux server with the minimum recommended hardware
